RAIN SENSOR
The working of rain sensor is based on electrical conductivity of water. Raindrop sensor is basically a board on which nickel is coated in the form of lines. When there is no rain drop on board, resistance is high. In the presence of rain drop, the parallel lines of coated nickel gets connected through rain drop as a conducting medium. Thus, the resistance gets reduced and there is corresponding drop in voltage which can be used to detect rain drop. 
Presence of water in sacks of grain can prove to be harmful as it can induce the growth of bugs and pesticides. The sensor can be used to detect rain in case the grains are kept in an open storage, or it can be used to detect presence of water leakages in closed grain storage facility.


The soil moisture sensor consists of two probes which are used to measure the volumetric content of water. The two probes allow the current to pass through the soil and then it gets the resistance value to measure the moisture value.

When there is more water, the soil will conduct more electricity which means that there will be less resistance. Therefore, the moisture level will be higher. Dry soil conducts electricity poorly, so when there will be less water, then the soil will conduct less electricity which means that there will be more resistance. Therefore, the moisture level will be lower.

Bluetooth

HC‐05 module is an easy to use Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Protocol) module, designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup. The serial port Bluetooth module is fully qualified Bluetooth V2.0+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) 3Mbps Modulation with complete 2.4GHz radio transceiver and baseband. It uses CSR Bluecore 04‐External single chip Rluetooth system with CMOS technology and with AFH (Adaptive Frequency Hopping Feature).
