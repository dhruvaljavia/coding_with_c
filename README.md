RAIN SENSOR
The working of rain sensor is based on electrical conductivity of water. Raindrop sensor is basically a board on which nickel is coated in the form of lines. When there is no rain drop on board, resistance is high. In the presence of rain drop, the parallel lines of coated nickel gets connected through rain drop as a conducting medium. Thus, the resistance gets reduced and there is corresponding drop in voltage which can be used to detect rain drop. 
Presence of water in sacks of grain can prove to be harmful as it can induce the growth of bugs and pesticides. The sensor can be used to detect rain in case the grains are kept in an open storage, or it can be used to detect presence of water leakages in closed grain storage facility.
